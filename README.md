## Module 4

### PyCitySchools Instructions

Using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, create a report that includes the following data.

#### District Summary
Perform the necessary calculations and then create a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame.

#### School Summary
Perform the necessary calculations and then create a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school.

* Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
* Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
* Math Scores by Grade
* Reading Scores by Grade
* Scores by School Spending

### Written Report

 #### Analysis Summary:
    Analyzing the entirety of the district, there were a total of 39,170 high school students whose scores were analyzed to determine average math and reading scores as well as the percentages of students who passed math and reading subjects. Of the 39,170 students averages are as follows:
    
    Average Math Score - 78.985371	
    Average Reading Score - 81.87784
    % Passing Math	- 74.980853
    % Passing Reading	- 85.805463
    % Overall Passing - 65.172326

Analyzing the district scoring averages as well as the district spending on a per school basis,a total of 15 high schools were analyzed to determine average math and reading scores as well as varying amounts of data on school spending. Analysis was done to dermine the highest and lowest peforming schools by percentages of overall passsing rate. The highest and lowest preforming schools are as follows:

Highest preforming schools:
1. Cabrera High School	
2. Thomas High School	
3. Griffin High School	
4. Wilson High School	
5. Pena High School	

Lowest preforming schools:
1. Rodriguez High School	
2. Figueroa High School	
3. Huang High School	
4. Hernandez High School	
5. Johnson High School	


  #### Conclusions/Comparisons:
* Charter schools has a significantly higher overall passing rate(90.43%) compared with the overall passing rate of the district schools(53.67%)
* There was no positive correlation between school spending buckets on a per student basis and average scores as well as overall passing rate. The schools in the lowest spending bucket per student basis(<$585) actually had the highest overall passing averages for math and reading.
